            Tailwind CSS: Utility-First Revolution
        </h2>
        <h3><b>Feautures</b></h3>
        <p>
            Utility-First: Tailwind’s atomic classes like bg-blue-500 and text-center allow for rapid prototyping and
            design
            iteration.

            Customization: Tailwind is highly customizable. You can configure your design system and generate utility
            classes that suit your needs.
        </p>

            <p class="quote">
                Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom
                designs
                without writing CSS from scratch. Its approach is radically different from traditional frameworks,
                focusing on
                small, reusable classes that can be composed to create any design.
